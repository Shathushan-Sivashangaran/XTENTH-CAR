# XTENTH-CAR
XTENTH-CAR (Xperimental one-TENTH scaled vehicle platform for Connected autonomy and All-terrain Research) aims to increase accessibility of experimental Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) and Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) research with low upfront costs, and complete Autonomous Vehicle (AV) hardware and software architectures, similar to the full-sized X-CAR experimental vehicle platform, enabling efficient cross-platform research and development between small-scale and full-scale vehicles.
