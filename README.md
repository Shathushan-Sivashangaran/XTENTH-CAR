# XTENTH-CAR
XTENTH-CAR (Xperimental one-TENTH scaled vehicle platform for Connected autonomy and All-terrain Research) aims to increase accessibility of experimental Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) and Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) research with low upfront costs, and complete Autonomous Vehicle (AV) hardware and software architectures, similar to the full-sized X-CAR experimental vehicle platform, enabling efficient cross-platform development between small-scale and full-scale vehicles.

## Hardware
The platform is equipped with the best-in-class NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin System on Module (SOM), stereo camera with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), barometer and magnetometer, 2D LiDAR and open-source Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) with drivers written in the new Robot Operating System (ROS 2) to facilitate experimental CAV and AGV research that incorporate state-of-the-art computationally expensive algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning.
