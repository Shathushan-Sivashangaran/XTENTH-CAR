# XTENTH-CAR: A Proportionally Scaled Experimental Vehicle Platform for Connected Autonomy and All-Terrain Research
XTENTH-CAR (Xperimental one-TENTH scaled vehicle platform for Connected autonomy and All-terrain Research) aims to increase accessibility of experimental (Connected Autonomous Vehicle) CAV and (Autonomous Ground Vehicle) AGV research with low upfront costs, and complete Autonomous Vehicle (AV) hardware and software architectures, similar to the full-sized X-CAR experimental vehicle platform, enabling efficient cross-platform research and development between small-scale and full-scale vehicles.
