# XTENTH-CAR
XTENTH-CAR (Xperimental one-TENTH scaled vehicle platform for Connected autonomy and All-terrain Research) aims to increase the accessibility of experimental CAV and AGV research with low upfront costs, and complete Autonomous Vehicle (AV) hardware and software architectures similar to the full-sized X-CAR experimental vehicle platform, enabling efficient cross-platform development between small-scale and full-scale vehicles.
